man curl

 -w, --write-out <format>
              Defines what to display on stdout after a completed and successful operation. The format is a string that may contain plain text mixed with any number of variables. The string can be specified as "string", to get read
              from a particular file you specify it "@filename" and to tell curl to read the format from stdin you write "@-".

              The variables present in the output format will be substituted by the value or text that curl thinks fit, as described below. All variables are specified as %{variable_name} and to output a normal  %  you  just  write
              them as %%. You can output a newline by using \n, a carriage return with \r and a tab space with \t.
              
              ...
              
              time_connect   The time, in seconds, it took from the start until the TCP connect to the remote host (or proxy) was completed.
              
              time_namelookup
                           The time, in seconds, it took from the start until the name resolving was completed.
              
              time_pretransfer
                           The time, in seconds, it took from the start until the file transfer was just about to begin. This includes all pre-transfer commands and negotiations that are specific  to  the  particular  protocol(s)
                           involved.
              
              time_redirect  The  time,  in seconds, it took for all redirection steps include name lookup, connect, pretransfer and transfer before the final transaction was started. time_redirect shows the complete execution time
                           for multiple redirections. (Added in 7.12.3)
              
              time_starttransfer
                           The time, in seconds, it took from the start until the first byte was just about to be transferred. This includes time_pretransfer and also the time the server needed to calculate the result.
              
              time_total     The total time, in seconds, that the full operation lasted. The time will be displayed with millisecond resolution.
```

一个例子:

```
curl -w '%{time_connect}\t%{time_namelookup}\t%{time_starttransfer}\t%{time_total}\n' 127.0.0.1:8080
```
